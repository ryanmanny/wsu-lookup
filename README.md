# WSU-Name-Lookup
Uses a [WSU endpoint](https://livingat.wsu.edu/cardinfo/deposit/default.aspx?mode=CC) to find student's names and birthdays from WSU ID

If any staff of the university wants me to take this repo down, so that they can remove this reverse lookup feature, please email me and I will do so immediately.

I do not endorse using this program for nefarious purposes, I have only ever tested it on my own ID number during development. This exists only as proof of potentially illegally negligent issues with the WSU website.

## TODO:
- Look into some more speed improvements (although it's pretty fast with async)
